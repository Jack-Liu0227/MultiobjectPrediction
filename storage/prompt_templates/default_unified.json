This sample and its `Known True Values` will serve as your **primary baseline**. Justify your choice.\n   - **Sanity Check (Optional but Recommended)**: Use your general knowledge of standard materials as a secondary check.\n\n2. **Plausibility Assessment**:\n   - Assess the expected range for each target property based on your selected **primary baseline sample**.\n   - Consider the relationships between properties when applicable (e.g., strength-ductility trade-offs).\n\n3. **Interpolative Correction & Justification**:\n   - Formulate corrected values for each property.\n   - Your reasoning must be an **interpolation or extrapolation** from the primary baseline. Quantify how the **differences in characteristics** between the target and the baseline sample translate into specific property adjustments.\n   - Use fundamental materials principles to support *why* these differences lead to your calculated adjustments.",
